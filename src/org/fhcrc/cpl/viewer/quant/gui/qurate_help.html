<h1>Qurate Help</h1>
<b>Qurate</b> allows you to view quantitative events from isotopically
labeled peptide experiments in several
different ways, and to judge them as 'good' or 'bad' events (or leave
them marked as 'unknown'). 'Bad'
events can be filtered out of the pepXML file in which they were
observed.<br>
<br>
Qurate contains
a robust workflow for selecting which events you wish to curate.<br>

<h2><a name="gui"></a>Curation Interface<br>
</h2>
<h3>Properties</h3>
The Properties table shows you information about the quantitative
event -- quantitative ratio, light and heavy areas, etc. Multiple
overlapping events (same peptide, same charge, similar retention time)
may be
rolled into a single event if they have similar ratios. Any overlapping
events
other than the one described in these properties will appear in
'OtherEventScans' and 'OtherEventMZs'.<br>
<h3>Algorithmic Assessment</h3>
When Qurate builds charts for an event, it also runs a subprogram that
uses several heuristics to identify events that "look" bad.&nbsp; These
events may have coeluting peaks one Dalton below the monoisotope; or
they may have very different peak distributions between heavy and
light; or, when calculating its own ratio for the event using only one
peak, that ratio may be very different than what the quantitation
algorithm produced.&nbsp; If any of these conditions holds true, the
event will be marked in red in this area, and details will be given.<br>
<h3>Curation</h3>
Provide your assessment of the current quantitative event here. You can
describe the quantitative event as "Bad" or "Good", or leave it as
unknown.&nbsp; You can do the same with the identification itself --
sometimes it will be clear from the charts that the identification is
probably wrong (e.g., the predicted monoisotopic mass is not the actual
monoisotopic mass).&nbsp; You can also type comments on the current
quantitative event into the text box.&nbsp; Your assessments and
comments will not be saved unless you explicitly save your changes (see
'Actions', below).&nbsp;
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Theoretical Peaks</h3>
This small graph shows the theoretical distribution of light and heavy
peaks for a peptide of
this mass, assuming that the ratio identified for this quantitative
event is correct.<br>
<h3>Event Control Buttons</h3>
The left and right arrows navigate the loaded quantitative events one
by one.&nbsp; The "Show All" button brings up a window with a table
containing all events; you can use this table to navigate to any event,
and to sort events in several ways.<br>
<h3>Charts</h3>
The charts help you assess the quality of quantitative events.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intensity Sum: </span>A plot of
the intensities summed over all of the scans within the range of the
quantitation event.&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Blue</span>
indicates intensities that are within a
narrow PPM window around each isotopic peak.&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Green</span> lines indicate
monoisotopic light and heavy peaks, and <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);">yellow</span> lines indicate
non-monoisotopic peaks.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Spectrum:</b> A heatmap showing the intensity of the region of
spectra around the quantitative event. Higher intensities are darker
    <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">blue</span>. <span
 style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Grey</span> areas on the left and
right indicate areas not used by the
quantitative algorithm.&nbsp; Horizontal axis shows increasing
scan number, Vertical axis shows increasing m/z. <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Red</span> tick marks on the
left and right indicate the light and heavy monoisotopic m/z values.
    <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Red</span> 'X' marks indicate
identification events.</li>
  <li><b>Scans:</b> A separate chart for each scan, showing peak
intensities. All intensities are normalized to the highest-intensity
value in any scan (which may or may not be included in the peptide
quantitation). Vertical <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">green</span>
and <span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);">yellow</span> lines
indicate monoisotopic
and non-monoisotopic peak m/z values, respectively.&nbsp; Scan numbers
are given at the left -- numbers in <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">green</span>
were used in quantitation, numbers in <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">red</span> were not.</li>
  <li><b>3D:</b> A 3D representation of the same data in the Spectrum
chart. Perspective is that of someone standing at a scan higher than
the last scan shown on the chart, near the m/z of the light
monoisotopic peak. Z axis is intensity. Solid <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">red</span> lines indicate the
light and heavy monoisotopic peaks. Dashed <span
 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">red</span> lines indicate the
beginning and end of algorithm quantitation.&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Blue</span> 'X' marks
indicate the event used in this
quantitative event. <span style="color: rgb(204, 153, 51);">Yellow</span>
'X' marks indicate other identification
events folded into this representation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="selecting_events"></a>Selecting Events for Chart Creation</h2>
There are two ways to select quantitative events for chart creation:
from a PepXML file (peptide level), or from a ProtXML file (protein
level).<br>
<h3>Peptide Level</h3>
To select and build charts for events by peptide identification, you
will need to provide a PepXML file, and mzXML file or directory of
mzXML files, and an output directory.&nbsp; You can do this from the
Tools menu, action "Create Charts...".&nbsp; You may also supply
minimum PeptideProphet probabilities ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">minpprophet</span>"),
particular
fraction names within the PepXML file ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">fractions</span>"),
output HTML and
tab-separated-value files ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">outhtml</span>"
and "<span style="font-weight: bold;">outtsv</span>"), particular
peptides
to investigate, particular associated proteins to investigate, and
individual scan numbers, as well as a number of advanced arguments,
described within the program, that control the details of how the
charts are made.&nbsp; When all of these parameters are selected, press
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Execute</span>" to immediately build
the charts and load them into the
graphical interface.<br>
<h3>Protein Level<br>
</h3>
For selecting events by protein identification, Qurate provides a
detailed interface that allows you to choose only those quantitative
events that you are interested in.&nbsp; Since generating the charts
takes some amount of time, and reviewing them manually takes more time,
you may wish to restrict your chart creation to, e.g., only events with
extreme ratios, or events for proteins with extreme ratios.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This workflow is accessed via the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open
ProtXML File</span>" option under the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">File</span>"
menu (or by pressing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ctrl-P</span>).&nbsp;
You will need to provide a ProtXML file, a directory containing all
relevant
mzXML files, and an output directory for the charts.&nbsp; You may also
specify the pepXML file explicitly (overriding the value in the ProtXML
file) and provide a file that maps protein accession numbers to gene
symbols
("<span style="font-weight: bold;">protgenefile</span>"), an output
file for all the quantitative events
("<span style="font-weight: bold;">out</span>"), a restrictive list of
proteins to consider ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">proteins</span>"),
a minimum ProteinProphet probability for proteins to consider
("<span style="font-weight: bold;">minproteinprophet</span>"), and a
maximum low protein ratio and minimum high ratio to consider ("<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">maxlowratio</span>" and "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">minhighratio</span>" -- proteins will only
be included if they fit at least one of those ratio bounds).&nbsp; The
optional "<span style="font-weight: bold;">appendoutput</span>"
argument controls
whether, if an output file is provided that already exists, the new
events will be appended to the existing events in the file or will
overwrite the current file.<br>
<br>
When you have provided these arguments, press "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Execute</span>".&nbsp;
This will bring up a new window with a table containing one row per
protein.&nbsp; You can save this table to a file for future reference
("<span style="font-weight: bold;">Save Table</span>").&nbsp; This
table can be sorted on any column.&nbsp; You can select rows (proteins)
manually, or you can click and drag on the histogram of log protein
ratios at the bottom of the window to specify low and high
ratios.&nbsp; As you change these values, <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">green</span> areas will appear to
the left (lower ratio) and right (higher ratio) of the region you
select.&nbsp; Solid vertical line indicates 1:1 ratio.&nbsp; Proteins
with ratios more "extreme" than this region will
be retained in the table; all others will be removed.&nbsp; The "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Select All Visible</span>" button will
select all proteins <span style="font-style: italic;">currently</span>
visible in the table.&nbsp; Once you have selected the proteins you
want, press "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Events</span>".&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
The next window shows a table with one row per quantitative event, from
all the proteins you selected, sortable on all columns.&nbsp; You may
see
multiple quantitative events for the same peptide.&nbsp; Any
events that are already loaded by Qurate will be greyed out. The
quantitative ratio for the event is displayed numerically, and also (in
log scale) as a graphical slider.&nbsp; This window also has a
log-ratio histogram that you can use to restrict the table to only
extreme-ratio events, but in this window, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">checkboxes</span> at the left are used for
the actual selection.&nbsp; The checkbox on the first row selects or
deselects <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> events.&nbsp;
You can view more information
about each event by pressing "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Show
Event Properties</span>".&nbsp; The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Show
Protein Table</span>" button opens a table with one row per protein and
another log-ratio histogram.&nbsp; You can select a row in this table
to populate the histogram with the events from that protein, and then
restrict the event ratios to extreme ratios in the usual manner; as you
drag the selection area, events in the event table will be checked or
unchecked appropriately.&nbsp; On this histogram, solid vertical line
indicates 1:1 ratio and dashed vertical line indicates the protein
ratio.&nbsp; The Protein Table also includes a scatterplot showing each
quantitative event in log-ratio space, color-coded by peptide; the Y
axis on this chart simply separates the peptides vertically.<br>
<br>
When you
select a set of events and press "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Build
Selected Charts</span>", the charts
will be built and loaded into the main Qurate interface; this can take
quite some time (many seconds per event), and a status bar will
indicate
progress.&nbsp; Any events for the same peptide, within the same charge
state, with the same modifications, with similar ratios, will be
bundled into a single set of charts; curation performed on one of them
will apply to all.<br>
