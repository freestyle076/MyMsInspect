You can access the graphical interface for msInspect by executing msInspect.exe (or using your Start Menu shortcut if you created one).  

If you wish to access the msInspect command line, open a command window (Start->Run..., type "cmd" into the text box and press "OK") and execute msInspect.exe with additional arguments, e.g.:


"C:\Program Files\msInspect\msInspect.exe" --usermanual


==========
= Memory =
==========

The Windows executable version of msInspect has one major limitation, which is that exactly 1GB of memory is made available to msInspect.  If you have less than 1GB of memory on your machine, or if you need more than 1GB of memory, please use the msInspect JAR file (viewerApp.jar, in the directory in which you installed msInspect) from the command line (see http://proteomics.fhcrc.org for details).
